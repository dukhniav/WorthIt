# WorthIt
* Application that will help eliminate impulse buying.

# TODO:
* Simple UI

## Steps:
1. Type in what item is and how much it costs (posibly integrate a scanner)
1. Have sliding questions to answer
  1. A few per purchase

* Checkboxes.
* Database of items that shows a history of impulse buying.

## Questions to ask:
* Do you need it or want it?
* Can you afford it?
* Can the money be better spent somewhere else?
* Are there cheaper alternatives?
